## About

This project is meant to be as lightweight as possible to help developers get started with electron and react as quickly as possible.

Because a new version of electron is used, Babel is not used for transpiling. Plain TypeScript is used instead.

Live reloading is included thanks to webpack 5 and webpack-dev-server.
